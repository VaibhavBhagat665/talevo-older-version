        <div class="chapter-text">
          <p>The sun hangs low on the horizon, painting the abandoned town in hues of amber and shadow. Your instincts scream that this is no place to be after dark. You turn back toward your parked car at the edge of town.</p>
          
          <p>As you walk down Main Street, the wind picks up, howling through the empty buildings. You quicken your pace, unable to shake the feeling of being watched from every vacant window.</p>
          
          <p>Halfway to your car, you notice something troubling. A thick mist is rolling in from the hills beyond town, unnatural in its movement—almost purposeful. It's flowing between buildings, curling around corners, advancing steadily toward you.</p>
          
          <p>You break into a jog, then a run. The mist seems to accelerate in response.</p>
          
          <p>The temperature drops sharply. Your breath comes in visible puffs now. Through the gathering mist, you spot your car—still a hundred yards away.</p>
          
          <p>A sound rises from the direction of town—voices calling out names, pleading, whispering. The cacophony grows louder as the mist thickens around you.</p>
          
          <p>Your car is close now, but the fog is faster, swirling around your legs as you run. In the mist, you begin to see faces forming and dissolving—expressions of terror frozen on features that twist and change.</p>
          
          <p>Just as you reach for your car door, a figure steps out of the mist directly in your path—a woman in dated clothes, her eyes hollow and dark.</p>
          
          <p>"You can't leave," she says, her voice echoing strangely. "No one leaves. Not anymore."</p>

        <div class="chapter-text">
          <p>"Who are 'they'?" you ask, your voice steady despite your racing heart.</p>
          
          <p>The ghost—for what else could it be—materializes more fully. A weathered man in his fifties, with a handlebar mustache and a dealer's visor. His form flickers like a faulty projection.</p>
          
          <p>"The miners," he says, his voice distant yet clear. "They found something deep in the earth. Something old. Something hungry."</p>
          
          <p>He gestures toward a chair. When you hesitate, he smiles sadly. "I ain't gonna hurt you. Been thirty years since I had someone to talk to."</p>
          
          <p>You carefully sit, keeping the ace of spades in your hand. The ghost nods approvingly.</p>
          
          <p>"Name's Sullivan. I ran the tables here when Prosperity was a mining boom town. That night... they came up from the mines covered in some kind of mist, eyes black as coal. Moved funny, like puppets. Started taking people."</p>
          
          <p>Sullivan's form wavers, emotions distorting his appearance. "Mayor ordered evacuation, but it was chaos. That mist... it followed people. Consumed them. Changed them."</p>
          
          <p>He points toward the window. "The ones that got changed, they left. Hunting. Spreading. But they come back sometimes. When the mist rises."</p>
          
          <p>Sullivan leans closer, his ghostly eyes intense. "You need to leave before sunset. But first... would you do an old ghost a favor? My lucky deck is still hidden in my room upstairs. With all the cards together, I might finally be able to move on."</p>

        <div class="chapter-text">
          <p>The card feels unnaturally cold between your fingers. With a startled gasp, you drop it, backing away as it flutters to the floor.</p>
          
          <p>The temperature plummets further. Your breath billows in front of you as frost forms on the bottles behind the bar.</p>
          
          <p>"<em>Wait, please!</em>" The ghostly voice rises in pitch, tinged with desperation. "<em>I've been alone so long!</em>"</p>
          
          <p>The air shimmers and the spectral form of a man in old-fashioned clothes materializes more fully—a poker dealer with a handlebar mustache and haunted eyes.</p>
          
          <p>"Name's Sullivan," he says, his form flickering like a bad television signal. "I ain't gonna hurt you. Just... tired of being alone all these years."</p>
          
          <p>You edge toward the door, but Sullivan's ghost drifts to block your path, his expression pleading.</p>
          
          <p>"Please," he says. "You're the first living soul to enter this town in decades who wasn't... changed. I need your help."</p>
          
          <p>Something crashes upstairs—a heavy thud followed by the sound of slow, dragging footsteps.</p>
          
          <p>Sullivan's expression turns to horror. "They're still here," he whispers. "Hiding in the buildings. Waitin' for the mist to return."</p>
          
          <p>The footsteps grow louder, descending toward the saloon floor. Sullivan's ghost flickers urgently.</p>
          
          <p>"Quick! You've got to hide—or run. Once they catch your scent, they won't stop hunting you."</p>

        <div class="chapter-text">
          <p>Pocketing the mysterious card, you decide to search the saloon for more clues. The ghost's presence is palpable—cold spots that follow you as you move through the room.</p>
          
          <p>"<em>I was the dealer here,</em>" the voice explains. "<em>Sullivan's the name. Was dealing a high-stakes game the night they came up from the mines.</em>"</p>
          
          <p>You move behind the bar, running your fingers over dusty bottles and tarnished taps. In the corner, you spot a leather-bound ledger.</p>
          
          <p>Opening it reveals a list of names with numbers beside them—tabs for regulars, perhaps. The final entry catches your eye: "Mayor Grayson - 50 - PAID IN FULL - Says the mine is closed indefinitely after accident. Something in his eyes didn't seem right."</p>
          
          <p>Sullivan's ghost materializes more fully now, watching you with interest. "The mayor was acting strange for days before it all went to hell. Him and the mine foreman both. Eyes all... wrong. Voices flat."</p>
          
          <p>You notice a small safe tucked under the bar, its door ajar. Inside is a stack of old photographs. The top one shows a group of miners standing proudly before a mine entrance. Their faces are circled in red ink, with a scrawled note: "All showing symptoms. Watching them."</p>
          
          <p>As you examine the photo, a noise from upstairs freezes you in place—heavy footsteps moving slowly across the ceiling.</p>
          
          <p>Sullivan's ghost flickers anxiously. "You need to go. Some of them never left town. They hide in the buildings, waiting. If the mist comes again tonight..."</p>
          
          <p>The footsteps upstairs pause, as if whatever is up there is listening.</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 3: Depths of Darkness</h2>
        <div class="chapter-text">
          <p>The mention of the mine sends a chill down your spine. You search through the filing cabinets until you find one labeled "Prosperity Mining Co."</p>
          
          <p>Inside are maps, reports, and financial records spanning decades. The most recent documents catch your attention—incident reports and a thick file stamped "CONFIDENTIAL" in faded red ink.</p>
          
          <p>Opening it reveals geological surveys and hastily written field notes. One report stands out, dated just days before the town's abandonment:</p>
          
          <p>"<em>Shaft 7 breakthrough exposes unusual cavity. Estimated age: pre-human. Hieroglyphics unlike any known language. Air samples show trace elements not on periodic table. Request immediate scientific team.</em>"</p>
          
          <p>Attached is a photograph showing miners standing before a massive dark opening. Their expressions are uneasy, and one figure in the back appears blurred, as if moving.</p>
          
          <p>A follow-up report, written the next day in shaky handwriting:</p>
          
          <p>"<em>Miller and Dawson exhibiting unusual symptoms after exposure to cave atmosphere. Pupils dilated, skin pallor, decreased responsiveness. Dr. Harris recommends quarantine. Foreman overruled, says we're behind schedule.</em>"</p>
          
          <p>The final document is a telegram from the State Health Department: "<em>URGENT. SEAL MINE IMMEDIATELY. CONTAINMENT TEAM EN ROUTE. EVACUATE TOWN. DO NOT ALLOW EXPOSED INDIVIDUALS TO LEAVE AREA.</em>"</p>
          
          <p>As you read, the temperature in the room drops noticeably. A soft hissing sound comes from the vents along the floor—like whispering voices. Looking down, you notice a thin tendril of mist seeping into the room.</p>

        <div class="chapter-text">
          <p>"I'll help you find your deck," you tell Sullivan, whose ghostly form brightens with hope.</p>
          
          <p>"Thank you kindly," he says, leading you toward a narrow staircase behind the bar. "Second door on the right. That was my room."</p>
          
          <p>The stairs creak ominously under your weight. Upstairs, a narrow hallway stretches into darkness, doors lining both sides. You count to the second door on the right and find it slightly ajar.</p>
          
          <p>Sullivan's room is small but was once comfortable. A bed with a metal frame sits against one wall, a simple dresser opposite it. A small table by the window still holds an oil lamp and what looks like a half-written letter.</p>
          
          <p>"In the floorboard under the bed," Sullivan instructs, hovering anxiously. "Loose plank."</p>
          
          <p>You kneel beside the bed, finding the loose board easily. Prying it up reveals a small cavity containing a velvet pouch.</p>
          
          <p>Inside is most of a deck of cards, ornately designed with silver edges now tarnished with age.</p>
          
          <p>"That's it!" Sullivan exclaims, his form becoming more solid as you combine the ace of spades with the rest of the deck. "My lucky deck. Won it from a traveling magician who said it was enchanted. Never believed him until... well, until I died and it kept me tethered here."</p>
          
          <p>As the complete deck rests in your hands, a sense of peace comes over Sullivan's features. "One last favor," he says softly. "Deal me a final hand. A proper send-off."</p>
          
          <p>You sit at the small table and deal five cards face down. Sullivan watches with anticipation.</p>
          
          <p>"Turn 'em over," he whispers.</p>
          
          <p>You flip the cards: a royal flush in spades. Sullivan's ghost laughs in delight.</p>
          
          <p>"Perfect," he says, already beginning to fade. "Now I can rest. But you need to leave town before dark. The mist is rising tonight—I can feel it. They'll be coming."</p>
          
          <p>His form grows transparent, but his voice remains clear: "The mine is at the north end of town. That's where it started. That's where you'll find answers—but I wouldn't go there if I were you."</p>
          
          <p>With a final nod of gratitude, Sullivan's ghost dissolves into motes of light that swirl briefly before dissipating completely.</p>
          
          <p>Through the window, you notice the sun is getting low. And in the distance, at the north end of town, an unnatural fog is beginning to form.</p>

        <div class="chapter-text">
          <p>The sun hangs low on the horizon as you make your way to the northern edge of town. Sullivan's warning echoes in your mind, but your curiosity is stronger than your fear.</p>
          
          <p>The mine entrance looms before you—a dark maw in the hillside, partially collapsed but still accessible. Faded signs warn of danger and a makeshift barrier of chain-link fence has been torn open.</p>
          
          <p>The mist is thicker here, swirling around your ankles as you approach. It seems to pulse with purpose, tendrils reaching toward you like curious fingers.</p>
          
          <p>You click on your flashlight and step through the torn fence. The tunnel beyond is supported by rotting timbers, the tracks for ore carts still visible beneath years of dust.</p>
          
          <p>As you venture deeper, the air grows increasingly cold and damp. The mist follows you, seeping through cracks in the walls and ceiling. Your flashlight beam seems to be absorbed by it, creating an eerie halo effect.</p>
          
          <p>After several minutes of careful progress, you reach a junction. The main tunnel continues straight ahead, while a smaller passage branches off to the right. A faded sign reads "Shaft 7" above the smaller tunnel.</p>
          
          <p>From the depths of Shaft 7, you hear something—a rhythmic sound, like chanting in an unknown language. The mist is denser there, pulsing in time with the distant voices.</p>
          
          <p>Your flashlight flickers, then dims drastically. In the reduced light, you notice something unsettling—the mist is faintly luminescent, giving off a pale blue glow.</p>
          
          <p>Ahead in the tunnel, shapes move in the mist—humanoid but wrong somehow. Their movements are jerky and uncoordinated, like marionettes with tangled strings.</p>
          
          <p>One turns toward you. Where its face should be is only swirling mist, but somehow you sense it seeing you. It raises an arm, pointing in your direction.</p>
          
          <p>Others turn. The chanting grows louder.</p>
          
          <p>Your flashlight dies completely, leaving only the ghostly blue glow of the mist illuminating the tunnel.</p>
          
          <p>The figures begin moving toward you.</p>
